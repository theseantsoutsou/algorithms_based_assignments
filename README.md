# algorithms_based_assignments

A collection of algorithms-based assignments that I completed at Monash University, namely the units FIT2004 Algorithms & Data Structures and FIT3155 Advanced Algorithms and Data Structures.
These projects generally revolve around one or two algorithms that we had learned, and it was up to us to modify them and realize a "trick" to solve a scenario-based problem.
